# Hubot Pipe

Introduce command piping and subshells to your Hubot commands.

```
# Expand the output from one command into the invocation of another.
hubot> hubot decide $(hubot echo first) $(hubot echo second)
Definitely "first".

# Append the output from one command to the input of another.
# Equivalent to "hubot echo before $(hubot echo after)".
hubot> hubot echo after | hubot echo before
before after
```

Subcommands can be nested at arbitrary depths. Pipe sequences can be arbitrarily long, and used within subcommands. (Okay, realistically you're limited by the stack depth.)

```
pushbot> pushbot echo outer-start $(pushbot echo middle-start $(pushbot echo inner) middle-end) outer-end
outer-start middle-start inner middle-end outer-end

pushbot> pushbot echo 0 $(pushbot echo 2 | pushbot echo 1 )3
pushbot> 0 1 2 3
```
